# Docker-free coverage for scripts/ensure-pr-staging-images.sh (#715) -- the
# fail-closed staging guard + untouched-service back-fill that reuses the
# #626/#627 pr-<N>-sha-<short> mechanism. The registry probe and the
# imagetools back-fill are stubbed via STAGING_IMAGE_EXISTS_CMD /
# STAGING_BACKFILL_CMD so the touched-vs-untouched decision and the
# fail-closed behaviour are exercised without a real daemon or registry. This
# is the safety property that keeps the deep gate from ever silently
# validating stale base-channel content behind a PR-looking tag.
#
# #895 congestion-probe coverage: the tests below stub
# STAGING_BUILD_RUN_STATUS_CMD (build_push_run_active()'s indirection) the
# same way the tests above stub the registry probe, so the extend-past-
# baseline / fail-fast-when-confirmed-dead / hard-ceiling behavior is
# exercised without a real `gh` CLI, network access, or a real build-push
# run. The default setup() below deliberately leaves BUILD_SHA unset, which
# proves the pre-#895 tests still get the original fail-at-baseline
# behavior unchanged (build_push_run_active() short-circuits on an empty
# BUILD_SHA without needing `gh` to be installed at all).
