# Known-good configuration snapshot contract (see
# docs/known-good-config-snapshots.md and issue #415).
#
# This is the canonical, documented reference implementation of the generic
# retention/validate/rollback functions every file-based runtime-managed
# service adapter follows. It is intentionally pure functions with no
# top-level executable code, so it can be sourced directly by tests.
#
# It is NOT copied into any container image via a shared Docker build
# context: each service Dockerfile (services/proxy, services/dhcp-proxy)
# builds from its own isolated directory with no shared-file context wired
# up (unlike the cdn-domains.txt `dns-domains` build context, adding a
# second shared context here would require the build-push.yml matrix to
# support multiple --build-context values per image, which none of its
# three job definitions do today). Instead, services/proxy/entrypoint.sh
# and services/dhcp-proxy/entrypoint.sh each embed a byte-identical copy of
# these functions between the marker comments
#   # BEGIN known-good-snapshot library (scripts/lib/known-good-snapshots.sh)
#   # END known-good-snapshot library
# tests/bats/known_good_snapshots_sync.bats fails the build if either
# embedded copy ever drifts from this file, so "generic" here means one
# documented, behaviorally-verified contract, not necessarily one physical
# file loaded at runtime.
#
# Snapshot layout on disk, rooted at <snapshot_root> (a service-owned
# persistent volume, never an ephemeral container layer):
#   <snapshot_root>/<id>/           one directory per validated snapshot
#   <snapshot_root>/<id>/<basename> one file per snapshotted config path
# <id> is a lexicographically sortable, monotonically increasing timestamp
# (date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S.%N), so plain `sort` gives chronological order
# without any extra index/bookkeeping file.

# kgs_log <level> <label> <message...>
# Emits one explicit, greppable log line for every snapshot lifecycle event
# (create, prune, rollback-select, reject) per the issue's acceptance
# criteria. level is a short tag: CREATE/PRUNE/SELECT/REJECT/FATAL.
